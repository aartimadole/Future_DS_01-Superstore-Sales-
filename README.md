# FUTURE_DS_01
📊 Superstore Sales Dashboard 📦

This project was developed during my internship to analyze **E-commerce sales data** using Power BI.  
The goal was to help business owners and decision-makers quickly understand:

- ✅ Best-selling products  
- ✅ Sales trends (monthly/seasonal peaks)  
- ✅ Revenue contribution by categories and regions  
- ✅ Top customers by sales  

The dashboard provides **interactive filters** (by year, month, region, category, etc.) and helps in data-driven decision-making.

## ⚙️ Steps Followed
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Fixed data types (Dates, Currency, Whole numbers, Text)
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values
   - Created a **Calendar Table** for time intelligence  

2. **Data Modeling**
   - Built relationships between Calendar and Sales data
   - Defined **DAX measures**: Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin %, YTD, YoY  

3. **Visualization**
   - KPI Cards → Sales, Profit, Margin
   - Line Chart → Monthly/Yearly sales trends
   - Bar/Treemap → Sales by Category & Sub-Category
   - Top-N Chart → Best-selling Products & Customers
   - Map → Regional Sales Distribution
   - Slicers → Year, Month, Region, Customer name

4. **Insights**
   - Sales peak during **November–December** (holiday season)
   - Technology & Office Supplies drive the most revenue
   - West and East regions contribute highest sales
   - Discounts increase sales but reduce profit margin
