📊 Superstore Sales Dashboard 📦

This project was developed during my internship to analyze **E-commerce sales data** using Power BI.  
The goal was to help business owners and decision-makers quickly understand:

 What I Did | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Data Cleaning in Excel** – trimmed text fields, removed duplicates, fixed date formats, handled missing values | Ensures visuals & metrics are accurate and reliable |
| **Calculated Metrics in Power BI** – total sales, profit margins, average sales per order, top-5 Product/Customer rankings, YoY & YTD growth | Helps track performance, set goals, and identify winners/weak spots |
| **Visualization & Storytelling** – bar charts, maps, tables, slicers for year/region | Makes complex data easy to understand and act upon |

---
- ✅ Best-selling products  
- ✅ Sales trends (monthly/seasonal peaks)  
- ✅ Revenue contribution by categories and regions  
- ✅ Top customers by sales  

The dashboard provides **interactive filters** (by year, month, region, category, etc.) and helps in data-driven decision-making.

4. **Insights**
